  Equity as Fairness, Care, and Transformation (transition)
  Demystifying, welcoming, validating, creating partnerships, representing, and deconstructing are equity-minded practices that are associated with three perspectives of equity discussed in Alicia Dowd’s and Estela Bensimon’s Engaging the ‘race’ question: Accountability and equity in US higher education . Each speaks to an aspect of equity that faculty and other practitioners must adopt if they are to serve students from racially minoritized groups in equity-minded ways. Below is a brief description of the equity perspectives and the equity-minded syllabus practice(s) with which they are associated.
