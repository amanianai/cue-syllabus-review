                   What is equity-mindedness? CUE uses the term equity-mindedness[1] Â to refer to the mode of thinking exhibited by practitioners who are willing to take responsibility for the success of historically underserved student from minoritized racial/ethnic groups and to critically assess their own practices as educators and/or administrators. Equity-minded practitioners do not solely blame students for their lack of success (a deficit-minded approach), nor do they rely on racial stereotypes or biases to justify or disregard inequitable outcomes. More specifically, equity-minded practitioners exhibit the following characteristics:

                 </p>
                 <p>
                   Critically race conscious;
Aware that practitioner beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and approaches are racialized and can have racial consequences, typically to the disadvantage of racially minoritized students;
Aware that norms, policies, practices that are taken-for-granted in higher education can perpetuate racial hierarchies and inequalities, even in the absence of explicit racism;
Willing to reflect on racialized outcomes and exercise agency to produce racial equity.
