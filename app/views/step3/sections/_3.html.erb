                     Institutional agents are individuals who have the capacity and commitment to transmit directly, or
                     negotiate the transmission of, institutional resources and opportunities (Stanton-Salazar, 1997).
                     Therefore, to care authentically means to reach out to students proactively and give them the tools they
                     need to succeed. Authentic care encompasses substantial help-giving actions and should not be confused with
                     being understanding or sympathetic. While understanding and sympathy may provide the motivation for help-giving
                     actions, alone they are not sufficient to make a difference in minority studentsâ€™lives.

                     Instructors take the time and trouble to equip students with the tools they need to succeed in college by showing them,
                     among other things, how to research and format a paper, outline their class notes and reading assignments, and study
                     effectively for exams.
