                <h2>Syllabi can reinforce and reproduce the norms and rules that generally align with the experience of white students, or syllabi can counter those norms and rules. For racially minoritized students who have experienced exclusion, marginalization, discrimination, and oppression in education and elsewhere, syllabi can be tools for equity-minded practice.</h2>
